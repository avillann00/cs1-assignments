Included in this repo are some of the assignments that I have done in my computer science 1 class, the class is data structures and algorithms in c. The topics range from implementing data structures from trees to queues and also sorting algorithms such as merge sort.
Not only that but it also helps reinforce basic skills such as reading input and performing mathematical operations. The assignments are based on a scenario that my professor had made up.
